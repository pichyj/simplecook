A simple website that allows people, mainly college students, to input what ingredients they have then the webpage generates different recipes with those ingredients, allowing users to click on recipes to find instructions.

Inspirations from this website were from [Encycolorpedia](https://encycolorpedia.com/d2e8ba#:~:text=Humbrol%2090%20Beige%20Green%20%2F%20%23d2e8ba,Color%20Code%2C%20RGB%20and%20Paints) and [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/13979302-Kitchen-secrets).

This was created for the class ART 101 at University of California Santa Cruz.
