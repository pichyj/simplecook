    "description": "Salt your flat iron steaks on both sides and let them sit, uncovered, in the fridge up to overnight, and at least 1 hour. I like to set them on a rack over a tray to catch any juices. This preseasons your meat and will help develop a better crust on the grill. Get your grill very hot and clean and oil your grates as I described above. When you start this process, take your steaks out of the fridge to warm up a bit. You still want them cool, though, so no more than about 15 minutes. Grill your flat iron steaks hard on one side, a good 5 minutes without touching them. Flip and grill to the doneness you like, anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the heat and the thickness of your steak. Use the finger test for doneness to determine this. Move your steaks from the grill, coat them with freshly cracked black pepper - or whatever spices and herbs you like - and let it rest 5 minutes. Slice across the grain (the narrow end), and squeeze citrus juice over it all.",

Peeling the cucumbers in alternating stripes helps them soak up seasonings while maintaining their shape. After being cut into bite-size pieces, they are combined with salt to draw out moisture, concentrating their flavor. Cubed avocado is tossed with lemon juice or vinegar to prevent browning, then everything is stirred together vigorously so that the avocado breaks down a bit to add a glossy coating. Finish with a hit of red-pepper flakes for heat, or embellish with herbs, lettuces, beans, soft-boiled eggs, feta, nuts and so on.",

Lay the duck breasts, skin-side down, in a non-stick sauté pan, then place over a low heat. Leave the duck for 15 mins to brown and release its fat, then flip over onto the flesh side for 5 mins. Remove the duck from the pan, then turn up the heat. Add the potatoes to the pan, fry until brown and crisp, then scatter over the parsley and garlic. Scoop out with a slotted spoon onto a plate, then season with salt. Keep the pan on the heat. Fry the bacon until crisp, then add the cabbage. Cook for 1 min, add a splash of water, then fry for 2 mins, just until the cabbage is wilted. While the cabbage is cooking, whisk any juices from the duck with the vinegar and olive oil. To serve, carve the duck breast into slices. Fan out on large dinner plates, spoon a neat bundle of cabbage on one side, then pile a serving of potatoes on the other. Drizzle over the dressing and serve.",
